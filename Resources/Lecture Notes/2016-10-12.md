## Project 4 Introduction: DoublyLinkedList

For Project 4, there are two downloads: LinkedListTester and StarterFiles.

Right now, we're just going to use the Tester files while we're building a doubly linked list,
and the project in StarterFiles will be used later on once  you have a Stack implemented.

Create a project for your DoublyLinkedList.

Download the LinkedListTester and extract the source files into your
project directory.

After adding "ListTester.hpp", "ListTester.cpp", and "main.cpp" to your project, it won't build immediately,
because it's expecting a DoublyLinkedList to exist.

**Create a DoublyLinkedList.hpp file in your project.**
